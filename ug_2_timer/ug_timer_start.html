        <h2>Test instruction: UG with timer: first digit odd, second even</h2>
        <blockquote>
          In the following test, you will see 100 numbers.
          <p>
            Your task is to <b>to click as quickly as possible, but still correctly</b>
            <br /> on the numbers (with the left mouse button) one after the other
            <br /> whose first digit is odd and whose second digit is even 
            <br />(e.g. 16, 74, 52 etc.).
            <br/> The test <b>must be completed within the displayed time (2 minutes)</b>. 
            <br/> The remaining time can be seen above the number field. When the timer expires, the test continues automatically.
          </p>

          <p>
            <font size="+1">Example:</font> <br />
            Below you can see an example from the first 20 numbers <br />
            <img style="border:2px solid;" src="vorschau.png" />
            <br /><br />The numbers marked here are correct.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should only go through the numbers once quickly without jumping
            back<br />
            and
            <b>answer as quickly as possible, but still correctly.</b><br />
            <b>At the end, click on the "Confirm!" button immediately!</b>
            <br />There will then be a second round, which you should complete
            in the same way.
          </p>

          <p>First, a test example with 16 numbers is performed.</p>
          <p>There is no time restriction in the test example.</p>
